2. Browser shows the default django message on the port 8000 ."The install worked successfully! Congratulations!"

3. Page not found. 404

4. It tracks changes to the models and applies them to the database schema as necessary.

5. We see all the models. admin.site.register(MODEL)

6. Looking at question 38. Looking at the results of question 38. Voting on question 38. 
I would get 404 page not found when I use string. Change int to str to allow any character.

7. It won't work with different path if we hardcode url.

8. Django does the hard work which we do not have to do. We can use generic views when there is a time 
constraint but if we want to to implement any special feature that django can't support then we should not use generic view.
